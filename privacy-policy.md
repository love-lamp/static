# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date: February 27, 2026**

This privacy policy applies to the **Lumee** app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by **Maksym Stoiakevych** (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Free service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".

## 1. Information Collection and Use

The Application is designed to respect your privacy to the fullest extent. The Service Provider **does not** collect, store, process, or transmit any personally identifiable information, IP addresses, usage analytics, marketing data, or account details.

The Application operates entirely locally between your mobile device and your Lumee smart lamp.

### Required Device Permissions
The Application requires certain device permissions strictly for its core functionality:

* **Bluetooth:** The Application uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to scan for, connect to, and send light effect commands to your local Lumee smart lamp.
* **Location Data (Android Only):** Due to the Android operating system's underlying requirements, the Application must request Location permissions (`ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` and `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`) in order to scan for nearby Bluetooth devices. **The Service Provider does not use, collect, track, store, or share your actual geographical location or GPS data.** The permission is used exclusively for establishing a Bluetooth connection with your hardware.

The Application does not use Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to process your data or provide features.

## 2. Third-Party Access

Because the Application does not collect personal or usage data, **no data is transmitted to, shared with, or sold to any external third-party services, advertisers, or analytics providers.** The Application communicates solely and locally with your Lumee smart device via Bluetooth or your local Wi-Fi network (only for initial device setup credentials transfer).

## 3. Data Retention Policy

The Service Provider does not collect any user data. Therefore, there is no user data to be retained, deleted, or managed by the Service Provider. All settings (such as custom lamp names or saved colors) are stored locally on your own mobile device and/or the smart lamp hardware itself. You can delete this local data at any time by uninstalling the Application or resetting your smart lamp.

## 4. Children

The Service Provider does not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13. Since the Application does not collect any personal information, no child's personal data is ever processed or stored.

## 5. Security

The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. While the Application does not collect personal data, we provide physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the Application's integrity and secure the Bluetooth communication with your smart lamp.

## 6. Changes

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes to the Privacy Policy by updating this page with the new Privacy Policy. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.

## 7. Your Consent

By using the Application, you are consenting to the terms set forth in this Privacy Policy.

## 8. Contact Us

If you have any questions regarding privacy while using the Application, or have questions about our practices, please contact the Service Provider via email at **maxym.stoiakevych@gmail.com**.
